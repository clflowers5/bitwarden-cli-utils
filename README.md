# Bitwarden CLI Utils

## Overview
Simple wrapper for the Bitwarden CLI to allow for easy retrieval and (eventually) management of credentials.

The project is written in TypeScript and compiled with declarations to a target of ES2015.

## Security
Security of your Bitwarden Username and Password should be a big deal, that's the keys to the kingdom!

`BitwardenUser` manages the `sessionKey` returned from a successful login for you for convenience. Any subsequent commands will append the `--session` option to the command so you don't have to worry about handling it.
